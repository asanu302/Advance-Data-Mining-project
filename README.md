Sound Classification from different source of sound data using data mining techniques.

# About
In this paper, we concentrate on the cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM), CRISP-DM is an open, freely usable data mining process. By taking various sound samples through the data processing stage, the spectrograms are obtained, and the sound is classified according to the frequencies in the spectrograms. Besides this, different machine learning classification algorithms is used such as random forest classifier, k-nearest neighbor (K-NN), support vector machine (SVM) and Artificial neural Network (ANN) are applied to model and compared at final stage.

# Question
To what extent proposed machine and deep learning algorithm can accurately classify different sources of sounds?

# Methodology
Cross Industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) is term used in the project development by extracting informative data patterns from qualitative data by using automated tools for business process [22].The dataset contains more than 8K rows of urban sounds from different objects, animals under 10 labels. 

# Modelling
1) In this paper, the data is classified as following steps. At first the feature engineering is done to derive important features as exploratory data analysis.  
2) The preprocessing of data is done at next stage which includes significant features data as training and test devoid of the noise   data.   
3) Then the model is passed through classifier like SVM, K-NN, ANN and RF classification algorithms are used to classify and the results will be compared by evaluation.  
4) In the end, machine learning models are used to evaluate by Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix, Epoch vs. Accuracy and F1 score.
